# Redux Exercises


There are 4 exercises. Each exercise should contain 3 files in the `src` folder:

* a main file
* a reducer file
* a test file

For example, the files for the counter exercise are:

* `Counter.js`
* `Counter.reducer.js`
* `Counter.test.js`

For each exercise, you may chose to do the exercise in this order:

* Use TDD to implement the reducer (tests are written for you for some of the exercises)
* Change the contents of `index.js` to import the main file of the current exercise
* Implement and test the code modifications needed for the main file of the exercise

However, you may also choose to do it out of order:

* Change the contents of `index.js` to import the main file of the current exercise
* Implement and test the code modifications needed for the main file and the reducer at the same time
* Go back and add tests for the reducer if needed and make sure they pass (make sure every tests fails at least once for the right reason)

## Setup

After downloading the zip file, you'll need to cd into the directory and `npm install`

## How to run tests

`npm test`
